# Image Classifier: Dog vs Cat
Welcome to the Image Classifier for Dogs and Cats! This repository houses a machine learning project focused on distinguishing between images of dogs and cats with high accuracy.

## Key Features:

- Learned Model: Utilizes a custom-trained deep learning model (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network - CNN) for robust image classification.
- Binary Classification: Specifically designed to differentiate between two classes: "dog" and "cat."
- Streamlit Web Application: Provides an interactive and intuitive web interface, allowing users to:
        - Upload an image (JPG, PNG, etc.).
        - Receive real-time predictions from the trained model.
        - See the predicted class (Dog/Cat).
- Easy to Use: Designed for simplicity, making it accessible even for users without a technical background.

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in computer vision tasks and showcases how Streamlit can be used to deploy interactive ML applications.
